% IA_SAVE saves the evaluated interaural level and time differences in the
%         MTLSIG - format. For each direction is stored only one channel,
%         that includes the interaural differences. The frequencies for which
%         the interaural differences are evaluated are stored, too. This is
%         done like a storage for nonlinear signals.
%
%         Description of the input arguments:
%         - save_name: filename for the storage
%         - level_difference: matrix including the interaural level
%                             differences. Each row represents one direction,
%                             each column represents the level differences
%                             for a certain frequency.
%         - time_difference: matrix including the interaural time differences.
%                            Each row represents one direction, each column
%                            represents the level differences for a certain
%                            frequency.
%         - direction_matrix: matrix including the elevation and azimuth
%                             angle of the different directions. The first
%                             row includes the elevation, the second row
%                             the azimuth. Each column represents a
%                             direction.
%         - n_directions: number of directions
%         - sampling_rate
%         - frq_axis: vector including the frequencies in [Hz], for which
%                     the interaural differences are evaluated.
%         - comment: commentary included in MTLSIG and SIGMAP files.
